# Hybrid identity

Contoso is a medium size financial services company with its headquarters in New York and a branch office in San Francisco. It is currently operating entirely on-premises, with majority of its infrastructure running on the Windows platform. Contoso has recently upgraded its Active Directory environment to Windows Server 2016 and it is in the process of migrating its desktops from Windows 7 to Windows 10.
 
Contoso is facing challenges related to increased mobility of its workforce and providing access to its services to other financial partners. Contoso is looking to improve security while providing users with self-service capabilities around device, account and password management. To drive better integration with partners, Contoso needs to provide access to some existing internal applications while maintaining a high level of security for applications hosted in the cloud and on premises while minimizing the effort required to manage customer identities.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to implement different components of a hybrid identity solution that integrates an Active Directory forest with an Azure Active Directory tenant and leverages a number of Azure Active Directory features.

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to plan, design, and deploy a hybrid identity architecture. The architecture will include a secure, available, and resilient hybrid identity infrastructure for identity and access management. 

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to implement different components of a hybrid identity solution that integrates an Active Directory forest with an Azure Active Directory tenant and leverages a number of Azure Active Directory features, including pass-through authentication with Seamless Single Sign-On, Multi-Factor Authentication, Self-Service Password Reset, Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory, Hybrid Azure AD join, Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Intune automatic enrollment, Azure AD Conditional Access, Azure AD Application Proxy, Azure AD B2B, and Azure AD B2C.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab you will setup and configure a number of different hybrid identity scenarios. The scenarios involve an Active Directory single-domain forest named contoso.local, which in this lab environment, consists (for simplicity reasons) of a single domain controller named DC1 and a single domain member server named APP1. The intention is to explore Azure AD-related capabilities that allow you to integrate Active Directory with Azure Active Directory, optimize hybrid authentication and authorization, and provide secure access to on-premises resources from Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations.
