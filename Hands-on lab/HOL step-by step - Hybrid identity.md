# Hybrid identity hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab you will setup and configure a number of different hybrid identity scenarios. The scenarios involve an Active Directory single-domain forest named contoso.local, which in this lab environment, consists (for simplicity reasons) of a single domain controller named DC1 and a single domain member server named APP1. The intention is to explore Azure AD-related capabilities that allow you to integrate Active Directory with Azure Active Directory, optimize hybrid authentication and authorization, and provide secure access to on-premises resources from Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations. 

## Overview

Contoso has asked you to integrate their on-premises Active Directory single-domain forest named contoso.local with Azure AD and implement all necessary prerequisites to allow them to benefit from such Azure AD features as single sign-on to cloud and on-premises applications, enhanced sign-in security with Multi-Factor Authentication and Windows Hello for Business, Hybrid Azure AD join, Self-Service Password Reset and Password Protection, automatic enrollment of Windows 10 devices into Microsoft Intune, and Azure AD Privileged Identity Protection. They want to also provide secure access to their on-premises, Windows Integrated Authentication-based applications from Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations, although they also want to be able to loosen restrictions when access originates from Hybrid Azure AD joined computers residing in their on-premises data centers. The same applications need to also be made available to Contoso's business partners. 

## Solution architecture

From the architectural standpoint, the deployment will consist of the following components:

-   On-premises Active Directory environment consisting of a single domain controller (DC1) and one domain member server (APP1), running Windows Server 2016 operating system. 

-   Contoso Azure AD tenant

-   Fabrikam Azure AD tenant

    ![High level architecture consisting of the on-premises environment represented by a rectangle on the left-hand side, two cloud outlines representing the Azure AD tenant of Contoso and Fabrikam on the right-hand side, and the Microsoft Intune icon in the middle. The on-premises environment contains an icon representing Active Directory domain controllers, providing such functionality as Azure AD Connect-based synchronization with attribute level filtering and password writeback, Azure AD Application Proxy with its on-premises connector, Service Connection Point for Hybrid Azure AD join, and Password Protection DC Agent. There is also a web server icon, representing the hybrid Azure AD joined server hosting the APP1 application, used also as the Password Application Proxy. The Contoso Azure AD tenant provides such functionality as Azure AD application proxy, My Apps portal, Automatic Intune enrollment, Enterprise State Roaming, Conditional Access, Azure AD Identity Protection, Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, Azure AD MFA, and Self-Service Password Reset.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/HOL_Architecture_Overview.png "Architecture Overview")

    $licensesToAssign = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AssignedLicenses
    $licensesToAssign.AddLicenses = $license
    $users = Get-AzureADUser | Where-Object {$_.UserPrincipalName -like "*@$domainName"}
    foreach($user in $users) { 
        Set-AzureADUserLicense -ObjectId $user.ObjectId -AssignedLicenses $licensesToAssign
    }
    ```

### Task 3: Enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication

In this task, you will configure user state-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication for members of the **Engineering - Mandatory MFA** group.

   > **Note**: In general, enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication using Conditional Access policies is the recommended approach, since it offers more flexibility. Setting Multi-Factor Authentication by modifying the user state requires users to perform two-step verification every time they sign in and overrides Conditional Access policies. On the other hand, this approach might be required if existing licensing arrangement does not include Conditional Access.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, on the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to install Azure AD MSOnline PowerShell module for Graph (select **Yes to All** when prompted whether to proceed with the installation):

2. On the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to sign into the Contoso Azure AD tenant. When prompted, sign in with the **john.doe** Azure AD user account, which you created in the previous exercise.

    ```pwsh
    Connect-MsolService
    ```

3. On the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication for all Azure AD user accounts with the UPN suffix matching the custom verified domain name of the Contoso Azure AD tenant. 

    ```pwsh
    $objectIdGUID = (Get-MsolGroup | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq 'Engineering - Mandatory MFA'}).objectId.Guid
    $users = Get-MsolGroupMember -GroupObjectId $objectIdGUID
    $st = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Online.Administration.StrongAuthenticationRequirement
    $st.RelyingParty = "*"
    $st.State = "Enabled"
    $sta = @($st)
    foreach($user in $users) { 
        Set-MsolUser -ObjectId $user.ObjectId -StrongAuthenticationRequirements $sta
    }
    ```

4. To verify the outcome, within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, in the the Edge browser window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **Users - All users** blade of the Contoso Azure AD tenant and select **Multi-Factor Authentication** (you might need to select **...** first).
